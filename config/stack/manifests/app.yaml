# Markdown description of this entry
readme: |
 This `provider-azure` repository is a Crossplane infrastructure provider for [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
 The provider that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

 * Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model Azure infrastructure and services (e.g. [Azure Database for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mysql/), [AKS clusters](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/), etc.)
 * Controllers to provision these resources in Azure based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
 * Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/concepts.html), enabling Azure resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
